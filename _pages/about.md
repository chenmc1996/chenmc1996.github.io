I'm a Ph.D. student in Nanjing university since Sep. 2020. More specifically, I'm in the [IIP group](http://iip.nju.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Chongjun Wang.

I'm mainly interested in deep learning under imperfect label information, including **semi-supervised learning** and **leanring with noisy labels**.
