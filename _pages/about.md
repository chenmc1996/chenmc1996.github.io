I'm a Ph.D. student in Nanjing university since Sep. 2020. More specifically, I'm in the [IIP group](http://iip.nju.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Chongjun Wang. 

I'm mainly interested in deep learning under imperfect label information, including **semi-supervised learning** and **leanring with noisy labels**. 

Currently, I'm doing my internship at Tencent AI Lab.

News
======
Our proposed method Robust LR achieves the best accuracy on mini-webvision with real-world label noise as in [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mini-webvision-1-0?p=longremix-robust-learning-with-high)! Wonder how long it will last :)
